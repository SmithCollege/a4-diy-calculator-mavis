Reflection on your experience with this assignment:

I found the instructions for this assignment pretty helpful, as well as the Wikipedia page on the shunting yard algorithm. Though I wasn't explicitly told how to write the code, the assignment instructions helped me wrap my head around what I was actually supposed to be doing each step of the way. I also think that the tests helped a lot in terms of knowing what was working and what still needed to be fixed. Writing the postfix method felt pretty straightforward, whereas the infix method was a bit more challenging. Sometimes it seemed like everything had been implemented to the best of my ability, and yet tests still weren't passing, which was a bit bothersome. Something that helped was writing print statements after different lines and being able to see when lines of code weren't reached, etc. It was super satisfying when I was able to get all tests passing, especially the ones that included exponents. Overall, I actually found this assignment to be pretty enjoyable.

This assignment does lend itself to more visual prototyping, so please feel free to go this route. Are you including slides, pseudocode, comments, or something else?

    Here's a link to some slides (I didn't know how else to include them):
